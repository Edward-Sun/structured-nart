# Fast Structured Decoding for Sequence Models

We are still working on code cleaning of our model, along with [hint-nart](https://github.com/zhuohan123/hint-nart).

Jiatao Gu has provided an excellent re-implementation of our model in the [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/nonautoregressive_translation/README.md) repo. We highly recommend you to try it!
